<h1> We Speak Too</h1>

<h1>New to Speaking or Want to Brush Up?</h1>
<br>
<h2>First let's dispel some common myths.</h2>

<ul style="list-style-type:none">
	<li><strong>You don't need to be an expert to speak on a subject.</strong> In fact, sometimes it's the best way to learn something new! You might not even have found your footing yet. One recent tech meetup was a fresh-out-of-undergrad man giving a talk on finding a job and his way in the industry.</li>

	<li><strong>There is no baseline for a talk to be "techy" enough.</strong> Don't think your talk or knowledge is "techy" enough? Nonsense! Beginner talks are often welcome, and once again you don't need to be an expert to speak on a subject. There are also many, many backgrounds fit for a good data or tech talk - project management, media, design, and more.</li>

	<li><strong>Public speaking isn't as scary as you think, and you might even like it.</strong> I promise! Practice can prove that. Start where you like. Giving short demos at meetups like <a href="https://www.meetup.com/DC-Hack-and-Tell/" target="_blank">Hack and Tell</a> can be a good first step. If you know Python, even at a beginner level, consider TAing or teaching a <a href="http://hearmecode.org/" target="_blank">HearMeCode</a> class. It defnitely won't be a nightmare. You definitely won't be naked.</li>
</ul>
