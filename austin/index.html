<p>Women, along with non-binary people, are <strong><a href="https://amaliebarras.github.io/MeetupSpeakerVizs/" target="_blank">woefully underrepresented</a></strong> as speakers at area professional events. This lack of representation can have far-reaching effects. Marginalized groups miss out on opportunities to be presented as leaders or experts in their fields. They are less likely to feel welcome to such groups, missing out on valuable learning and networking opportunities.

<br><br>This is a list of women and non-binary people in the Austin area who are interested in speaking at local tech and data professional events.
<br><br>

<strong>Austin women and non-binary people:</strong> Add yourself to this list! You can either fork the Github repository</a> or <a href="mailto:hello@amaliebarras.com" target="_blank">email me</a> your information. New to speaking? <a href="./resources.html">Check out the speaker resources.</a>
<br><br>

<strong>Everyone</strong>: Share this with women and non-binary people in your life that you think are or would make great speakers.
