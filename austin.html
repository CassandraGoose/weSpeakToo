<p>Women, along with non-binary people, are <strong><a href="https://amaliebarras.github.io/MeetupSpeakerVizs/" target="_blank">woefully underrepresented</a></strong> as speakers at Austin professional events. This lack of representation can have far-reaching effects. Marginalized groups miss out on opportunities to be presented as leaders or experts in their fields. They are less likely to feel welcome to such groups, missing out on valuable learning and networking opportunities.

<br><br>This is a list of women and non-binary people in the Austin area who are interested in speaking at local tech and data professional events.
