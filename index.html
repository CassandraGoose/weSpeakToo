<p class="content">Women and non-binary individuals are woefully underrepresented as speakers at professional technology events as shown by recent research in <a href="http://www.datalensdc.com/meetupSpeakers.html" target="_blank">Washington, DC</a> and <a href="https://amaliebarras.github.io/MeetupSpeakerVizs/" target="_blank">Austin.</a>This lack of representation can have far-reaching effects. Marginalized groups miss out on opportunities to be presented as leaders or experts in their fields. They are less likely to feel welcome to such groups, missing out on valuable learning and networking opportunities. We want everyone to know that<strong> we speak too</strong>.
